1. We need to add new functionality to the CentralUnit.cs file that makes a new sensor of type below, taking an ID and Location
	a. Door
	b. Window
	c. Motion
	d. Fire

2. If given an invalid type, it should return ArgumentException

3. What things in this file have code smells?

4. What can you do, in this file, to "leave it better than when you worked in it?"
	* faciliator, list those things, note them all, then have the class stack rank them from low risk -> high risk

5. Look at parseRadioBroadcast, what does it do?

6. What tests do you need to write to insure that ParseRadioBroadcast works?

7. Can you extact the "sensorTestStatusMap" into it's own diagnostics class?
	a. What tests would you need, if any, to verify that you don't break anything?
	b. Are there other things that might belong in this new diagnostics class that don't belong in the CentralUnit?
